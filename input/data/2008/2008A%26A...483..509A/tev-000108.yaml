  # The text states that an elongated Gaussian was fitted to get the
  # source centroid. But no extension is given in the paper!
  # No, really, they do a big fuss about the morphology, but then
  # don't actually publish their measurement.
  # To have a spatial model at all, we here put as Gaussian
  # width half of the spectral extraction radius.
  # This is a made-up extension, not a number given in the paper.
