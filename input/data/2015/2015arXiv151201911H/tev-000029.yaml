# The spectrum listed here is for the entire remnant measurement from Table 1
# The paper also gives results for 3 sub-regions, not listed here.
#
# TODO: the spectral norm is quoted in a weird way as
# 9.92 ± 0.90 (/550 GeV) * 10−13 TeV
# We should check against the spectral points or ask the corresponding author if this is correct:
