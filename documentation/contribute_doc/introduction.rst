So you want to contribute to gamma-cat?

Really? Are you sure?

Great! Read on ...

There are many ways to contribute to **gamma-cat**. We need more people that help
with data entry, review data in gamma-cat for completeness and accuracy,
improve the documentation, the data format schemas and the Python scripts.

We will try to describe and explain how everything works here in the contributor documentation.
But we realise that in the end we will probably fall short, and if you try to contribute
you will have questions about YAML or ECSV or schemas or get stuck with a git on Python question.
If that happens, please don't give up, but contact us and we will help!

Everything happens on **Github** here: https://www.github.com/gammapy/gamma-cat

This is a git repository that contains everything related to gamma-cat: the data entry in the
``input`` folder, the script ``make.py`` and ``gammacat`` folder with the Python scripts to
generate the output files, which at the moment are in the ``docs/data`` folder. The documentation
at https://gamma-cat.readthedocs.io is generated from the RST files in that repo. But not just
all the files and version control is there, Github is also the place to file "issues" for question,
discussion, feature or data entry requests, bug reports (see https://github.com/gammapy/gamma-cat/issues).
And it is also the place where all changes and additions happen, via "pull requests"
(see https://github.com/gammapy/gamma-cat/pulls ).

So if you want to contribute to gamma-cat, you have to make an account on Github.
It's free and should just take a minute.
You can then find a lot of information about git and Github here: https://help.github.com/

There you will find documentation how to open "issues" and "pull requests" and resources how to learn git,
as well as how to do basic things like edit or add a file directly via the Github web interface.
This means that you can do some data entry or documentation improvements for gamma-cat in a simple way.
If you're new to Github and git, and the explanations below aren't clear to you, then what you can do
is to open a new issue in the gamma-cat issue tracker where you describe what you want to do
(i.e. add or change something), and then we'll try to help you do it, i.e. make your first pull request.

The following pages give you more information, focusing mostly on how to
do data entry for gamma-cat, since this will be the most common way for people to contribute.
