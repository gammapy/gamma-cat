.. Overview

With gamma-cat, we provide two data products:

1. A source catalog
2. The full data collection

The following sections describe how to download them.

For now the latest version of the files is here: https://github.com/gammapy/gamma-cat/tree/master/docs/data

TODO: set up an easier way to download the files, directly from this page.
